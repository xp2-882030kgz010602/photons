The first 3 lines tell the program the period, the width, and the rule, in that order. The rule is represented by 18 1s or 0s, representing the transitions B2ckn3cinqry4cintyz5er6i in that order. Afterwards, the next p lines specify the starting panel, which the program will try to extend a backend off of. Any further lines specify more rows behind the given panel, with one row per panel. This is because given a panel and one row from the next panel, the next panel can be uniquely determined.
